Cole Geissinger's DotFiles
==========================

Contains all the good stuff that produces my preferred configuration on my computer

Really, a lot of this is a compilation from [Paul Irsh](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles), [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) and [Simon Owen](https://github.com/s10wen/dotfiles), but tweaked to me preference.
